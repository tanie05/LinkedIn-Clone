**Project Overview:**

**Technology Stack:**  
This project is developed using the MERN stack, incorporating JWT Token for secure authentication, Styled-components for enhanced styling, and Material UI Icons for an improved user interface.

**Key Features:**  
- **User Profiles:** Users can create customizable profiles, including profile pictures, cover pictures, and sections for personal information and key expertise.

- **CRUD Operations:** Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on both regular posts and job posts.

- **Bookmarking:** Users have the ability to save posts and job posts from other users for later reference.

- **Group Creation:** Users can create, join, or leave groups. Groups come with cover images, titles, and descriptions. Users can also create posts within these groups.

- **Locking Job Posts:** Job posts can be locked by their creators when they are no longer accepting applications.

- **Responsive Design:** Our project features a responsive and intuitive design for a seamless user experience.

**Future Plans and Ideas:**
- **Search Feature:** We plan to implement a robust search feature that allows users to search for other users, posts, jobs, and groups with ease.

- **Job Filters:** Users will be able to filter job posts based on criteria such as location, seniority level, and job type, enhancing their job search experience.

- **Email Verification:** To ensure the use of valid and existing email addresses during account creation, we intend to implement email verification as a security measure.

This project serves as a LinkedIn-inspired platform with a focus on professionalism, user-friendliness, and future expansion to provide even more valuable features to our users.
